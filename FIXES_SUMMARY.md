# Edge Case Fixes - Summary Report

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Fixed

#### 1. Schema Mismatch (DATABASE BUG)
**Problem:** Database created `name` column, but app used `first_name`/`last_name` everywhere
**Fix:** Updated schema in `init_db()` to use `first_name` and `last_name` columns
**Impact:** App now works correctly with proper name storage
**File:** `app.py` line ~56

---

#### 2. Admin Session Timeout (SECURITY)
**Problem:** Admin sessions never expired, security risk if computer left unlocked
**Fix:**
- Added `ADMIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES = 30` constant
- Implemented session timeout check in `admin_required` decorator
- Tracks last activity timestamp
- Auto-logout after 30 minutes inactivity
**Impact:** Significantly improved security
**Files:** `app.py` lines ~24, ~338-358, ~596

---

#### 3. Week Advancement Mass Forfeit Warning
**Problem:** Admin could accidentally jump from Week 1 to Week 8, forfeiting all matches without warning
**Fix:**
- Added pre-check that counts unreported matches that will be forfeited
- Shows warning with exact count
- Requires confirmation checkbox before proceeding
- Added UI checkbox in admin template
**Impact:** Prevents accidental data loss
**Files:** `app.py` lines ~712-738, `templates/admin.html` lines ~33-40

---

#### 4. Double Forfeit in Playoffs
**Problem:** Double forfeit produced no winner, broke playoff advancement
**Fix:**
- Enhanced `determine_winner()` with clear comment about double forfeits
- Added check in `advance_playoff_winners()` for zero winners scenario
- Admin can now manually intervene by deleting/re-reporting match
**Impact:** Playoff bracket won't hang, admin has control
**File:** `app.py` lines ~1157-1162, ~1085-1088

---

#### 5. Database Connection Error Handling
**Problem:** No error handling if database connection failed
**Fix:** Added try/catch in `get_db()` with user-friendly error message
**Impact:** Graceful degradation instead of 500 errors
**File:** `app.py` lines ~32-39

---

### üü° MEDIUM - Fixed

#### 6. Playoff Advancement Infinite Loop Protection
**Problem:** Recursive `advance_playoff_winners()` had no depth limit
**Fix:** Added `_recursion_depth` parameter with MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH=10 limit
**Impact:** Prevents stack overflow in edge cases
**File:** `app.py` lines ~1071-1094

---

#### 7. Score Validation
**Problem:** No validation on score values, allowed 999-0 typos
**Fix:** Added maximum score limit of 99 with helpful error message
**Impact:** Catches typos before they corrupt rankings
**File:** `app.py` lines ~280-282

---

## üìã Issues Addressed via Admin Control

These issues are handled by giving you (the admin) the tools to fix them:

#### 8. Player Deletion Mid-Season
**Solution:** System blocks deletion with clear error messages. You can:
- Delete players with NO reported matches (safe)
- Can't delete players with reported matches (blocked)
- Can't delete players in playoffs (blocked)
- Must wait until season end to remove active players

#### 9. Schedule Regeneration Data Loss
**Solution:** Enhanced warnings and confirmations:
- Shows count of matches to be deleted
- Requires hidden form field confirmation
- JavaScript dialog warns about data loss
- You control when this happens

#### 10. Match Corrections
**Solution:** Admin can delete bad matches and have players re-report:
- Delete button in admin dashboard
- Players can then report again
- Rankings auto-update
- ADMIN_GUIDE.md includes SQL commands for manual fixes

#### 11. Playoff Bracket Issues
**Solution:** Admin can manually intervene:
- Delete problematic matches
- Force playoff regeneration
- Direct database access for complex fixes
- ADMIN_GUIDE.md documents all procedures

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations (Acceptable)

These are edge cases that are documented but not "fixed" because the current behavior is acceptable:

#### 12. Duplicate Names
**Status:** Not fixed - acceptable limitation
**Reason:** CEC ID is unique identifier, duplicate names are allowed
**Workaround:** Display shows "John Smith (abc123)" format when needed

#### 13. No Head-to-Head Tiebreaker
**Status:** Not fixed - acceptable limitation
**Reason:** Current tiebreaking (wins ‚Üí point diff ‚Üí points scored ‚Üí name) is sufficient
**Future Enhancement:** Could add head-to-head as tiebreaker level

#### 14. Timezone Display
**Status:** Not fixed - acceptable limitation
**Reason:** All users in same office/timezone
**Workaround:** Times stored in UTC, displayed as-is

#### 15. BYE Wins Don't Count
**Status:** Current behavior is CORRECT
**Reason:** BYEs should not affect statistics
**Protection:** SQL queries filter `WHERE player2_id IS NOT NULL`

#### 16. Concurrent Admin Actions
**Status:** Low priority
**Reason:** Single admin expected, low traffic
**Mitigation:** Database locks handle basic conflicts

#### 17. No Undo Stack
**Status:** Acceptable limitation
**Reason:** Database backups provide recovery
**Workaround:** Backup database before major operations

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

Before deploying these fixes, test:

1. ‚úÖ **Schema migration:** Verify existing database handles new schema (if any data exists)
2. ‚úÖ **Admin timeout:** Login, wait 31 minutes, verify logout
3. ‚úÖ **Week advancement warning:** Try jumping weeks, verify warning appears
4. ‚úÖ **Player deletion protection:** Try deleting player with reported match, verify blocked
5. ‚úÖ **Schedule regeneration warning:** Verify confirmation required
6. ‚úÖ **Score validation:** Try entering 999-0, verify error
7. ‚úÖ **Double forfeit playoff:** Create playoff with double forfeit, verify doesn't hang

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Backup current database:**
   ```bash
   cp league.db league_backup_pre_fixes.db
   ```

2. **Commit and push changes:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Fix critical edge cases: schema, session timeout, warnings, validations"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy to Render:**
   - Render will auto-deploy from main branch
   - Verify `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable is set
   - Check deployment logs for any errors

4. **Verify fixes in production:**
   - Test admin login
   - Try advancing weeks (verify warning)
   - Check player deletion (verify protection)
   - Verify scores validate correctly

5. **Monitor for 24 hours:**
   - Watch for any errors in Render logs
   - Test normal user workflows
   - Verify admin session timeout working
